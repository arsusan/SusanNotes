            <h2>5 Methods of Note-Taking</h2>
            <p class="author">By: Angelina Burkholder | December 2, 2022</p>
            <div class="blog-content">
                <h3>Charting Method</h3>
                <p>Separate your paper into columns headed by categories. These could include important dates, people,
                    events,
                    phrases, etc. For example, the columns in a history class could be "Date," "Person," and
                    "Significance."
                    During class or as you read, write down the information that you learn under the appropriate column.
                    This
                    is a great method to use when the content is difficult to understand or presented quickly, as it
                    allows
                    you to get an overview of the lecture in your own words. This is also a good way to organize your
                    thoughts
                    and helpful for visual learners to memorize content.</p>
                <h3>Cornell Method</h3>
                <p>Separate your paper into three sections. The largest section is where you will record information
                    from
                    the
                    lecture using sentences. After the lecture is completed, you will fill out the column to the left of
                    the
                    largest section. This is where you will record the main ideas and anticipate test questions.
                    Finally, at
                    the bottom of the paper, is a summary of the lecture. This should be completed immediately after the
                    lecture
                    because this is when the information will be freshest in your memory. The Cornell method of
                    notetaking
                    is
                    excellent because it utilizes the "three-pass" approach to learning—meaning you encounter the
                    material
                    in three different ways. This is optimal for retaining the information in your memory for good.</p>
                <h3>Outline Method</h3>
                <p>Place the main and most important points farthest to the left of your paper. As information that is
                    more
                    specific is given, indent to the right. The more to the right a point is, the less important it is.
                    It's
                    important to note that once a new topic is started, you should begin at the left margin once more.
                    Your
                    outline should be a well-organized system where each subheading relates back to the original heading
                    in
                    the left margin. Outlining reduces editing, records content and relationships, and allows for easy
                    reviewing.</p>
                <h3>Sentence Method</h3>
                <p>Simply write every new thought, topic, or fact on a new line. While similar to the outline method,
                    this
                    method
                    is easier to use when the material is difficult or delivered quickly. It is best to immediately
                    review
                    these
                    notes after class and rank what information is most important and least important.
                </p>
                <h3>Mapping Method</h3>
                <p>Identify the main topic and underline it at the top or middle of your paper. Identify the sub-topics
                    or
                    supporting main ideas and place them around or under the main topic. Continue down or outward until
                    you
                    cover all the relevant information. Color coding or changing the shape of the bubble depending on
                    where
                    the information came from could be helpful. For example, a rectangle for book information and an
                    oval for
                    lecture information. The mapping method allows you to clearly see a topic from a global perspective.
                </p>
                <h3>The Note-Taking Method for You</h3>
                <p>If you’re unsure which method fits your learning style best, start from the top and try each one.
                    Keep in
                    mind that one method might work well for one class but not necessarily all of your classes. So,
                    don’t be
                    afraid to try out multiple and keep switching them out when you feel your retention starts to stall.
